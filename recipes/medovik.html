    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Medovik is a layer cake popular in countries of the former Soviet Union. 
    The identifying ingredients are honey and smetana (sour cream) or condensed milk.
    It is a dessert which is known for its lengthy preparation time. It consists of 
    layers of sponge cake with a cream filling and is often covered with nuts or crumbs 
    made from leftover cake. While the thin layers harden shortly after coming out of 
    the oven, the moisture of the filling softens it again over time. There are many recipes 
    and variations of this cake, but, the main ingredient is honey, giving it the characteristic 
    taste and flavor.</p>
