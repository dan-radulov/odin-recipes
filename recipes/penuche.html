    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Penuche is a fudge-like candy made from brown sugar, butter, and milk, using no
     flavorings except for vanilla. Penuche often has a tannish color, and is lighter 
     than regular fudge. It is formed by the caramelization of brown sugar; thus, its 
     flavor is said to be reminiscent of caramel.</p>
